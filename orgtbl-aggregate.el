;;; Commentary:
;;
;; A new org-mode table is automatically updated,
;; based on another table acting as a data source
;; and user-given specifications for how to perform aggregation.
;;
;; Example:
;; Starting from a source table of activities and quantities
;; (whatever they are) over several days,
;;
;; #+TBLNAME: original
;; | Day       | Color | Level | Quantity |
;; |-----------+-------+-------+----------|
;; | Monday    | Red   |    30 |       11 |
;; | Monday    | Blue  |    25 |        3 |
;; | Tuesday   | Red   |    51 |       12 |
;; | Tuesday   | Red   |    45 |       15 |
;; | Tuesday   | Blue  |    33 |       18 |

;; | Thursday  | Red   |    49 |       30 |
;; | Friday    | Blue  |     7 |        5 |
;; | Friday    | Blue  |     6 |        8 |
;; | Friday    | Blue  |    11 |        9 |
;;
;; an aggregation is built for each day (because several rows

  "Convert the Org Mode TABLE to an aggregated version.

The resulting table contains aggregated material.
Grouping of rows is done for identical values of grouping columns.
For each group, aggregation (sum, mean, etc.) is done for other columns.

The source table must contain sending directives with the following format:
#+ORGTBL: SEND destination orgtbl-to-aggregated-table :cols ... :cond ...

The destination must be specified somewhere in the same file
with a block like this:
  #+BEGIN RECEIVE ORGTBL destination
  #+END RECEIVE ORGTBL destination

PARAMS are parameters given in the #+ORGTBL: SEND line.

:cols     gives the specifications of the resulting columns.
          It is a space-separated list of column specifications.
          Example:
             P Q sum(X) max(X) mean(Y)
          Which means:
             group rows with similar values in columns P and Q,
             and for each group, compute the sum of elements in
             column X, etc.

          The specification for a resulting column may be:
             COL              the name of a grouping column in the source table
             hline            a special name for grouping rows separated
                              by horizontal lines
             count()          give the number of rows in each group
             list(COL)        list the values of the column for each group
             sum(COL)         sum of the column for each group
             sum(COL1*COL2)   sum of the product of two columns for each group
             mean(COL)        average of the column for each group
             mean(COL1*COL2)  average of the product of two columns per group
             meane(COL)       average and estimated error
             hmean(COL)       harmonic average
             gmean(COL)       geometric average
             median(COL)      middle element after sorting them in each group
             max(COL)         largest element of each group
             min(COL)         smallest element of each group
             sdev(COL)        standard deviation (divide by N-1)
             psdev(COL)       population standard deviation (divide by N)
             pvar(COL)        variance of values in each group
             prod(COL)        product of values in each group
             cov(COL1,COL2)   covariance of two columns, per group (div. by N-1)
             pcov(COL1,COL2)  population covariance of two columns (div. by N)
             corr(COL1,COL2)  linear correlation of two columns

:cond     optional
          A lisp expression to filter out rows in the source table.
          When the expression evaluate to nil for a given row of the
          source table, then this row is discarded in the resulting table.
          Example:
             (equal Q \"b\")
          Which means: keep only source rows for which the column Q
          has the value b

Names of columns in the source table may be in the dollar form,
for example use $3 to name the 3th column,
or by its name if the source table have a header.
If all column names are in the dollar form,
the table is supposed not to have a header.
The special column name \"hline\" takes values from zero and up
and is incremented by one for each horizontal line.

Example:
add a line like this one before your table
,#+ORGTBL: SEND aggregatedtable orgtbl-to-aggregated-table \\
           :cols \"sum(X) q sum(Y) mean(Z) sum(X*X)\"
then add somewhere in the same file the following lines:
,#+BEGIN RECEIVE ORGTBL aggregatedtable
,#+END RECEIVE ORGTBL aggregatedtable
Type \\<org-mode-map> & \\[org-ctrl-c-ctrl-c] into your source table

 To use the \"pull\" mode, look at the org-dblock-write:aggregate function.

Names of columns in the source table may be in the dollar form,
for example $3 to name the 3th column,
or by its name if the source table have a header.
If all column names are in the dollar form,
the table is supposed not to have a header.
The special column name \"hline\" takes values from zero and up

  #+END
